You need to create a project in the google cloud firebase. That is for only FIRESTORE not REALTIME DATABASE, and its test database.  

I can't add the whole project but it's too big. Simply, just create new flutter project with 


flutter create projectName


Then only change main.dart and pubspec.yaml accordingly. If you want, you can only change dependencies inside the pubspec.yaml too. That would work. 

This works at 4 May of 2021, in future some code might be deprecated by flutter devs.
